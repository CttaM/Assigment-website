        <p1> Task 4 involved thinkning about the user experience of our website. We needed to have discussed the strategy and scope, and then 
            produce and flowchart and wireframes based on what we discussed.  </p1>
        </div>

            <h2> Strategy </h2>
        <div id="task-1-text">
            The user for the website would mainly be people involved in the project, this includes: Mary Jackson, Mic Palmer and classmates. The reason why the website will mainly be used by Mary Jackson and Mic Palmer is that they will mark it. However, classmates are another group because they could provide feedback. However the website can also be for people who are not involved in the project such as: potential employers, friends and family. Although the website is not primarily designed for these groups of people, it could be viewed by future employers to demonstrate my skills and how they have progressed. The goals for the website are for it to be: usable, used as a portfolio piece and to learn from. These goals will not help me achieve marks for this project and also help develop my skills to push even further. 
        </div>

        <h2> Scope </h2>
        <div id="task-1-text">
            The website ought to function like any other website, so it needs: navigation, responsiveness to screen size, links and images. These are basic functions of a website and therefore are needed for my website to have a basic level of functionality. For the content that would be displayed there would be: CARP task, typo task, coding task, UX task and a report. However, additional content could be added such as: other previous projects, information about myself and other images/videos/sounds.
