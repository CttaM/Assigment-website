        <h2 class="subheading"> Task 4</h2>
        <div id="task-1-text">
        <p1> Task 4 involved thinkning about the user experience of our website. We needed to have discussed the strategy and scope, and then 
            produce and flowchart and wireframes based on what we discussed.  </p1>
        </div>

            <h2> Strategy </h2>
        <div id="task-1-text">
            The user for the website would mainly be people involved in the project, this includes: Mary Jackson, Mic Palmer and classmates. The reason why the website will mainly be used by Mary Jackson and Mic Palmer is that they will mark it. However, classmates are another group because they could provide feedback. However the website can also be for people who are not involved in the project such as: potential employers, friends and family. Although the website is not primarily designed for these groups of people, it could be viewed by future employers to demonstrate my skills and how they have progressed. The goals for the website are for it to be: usable, used as a portfolio piece and to learn from. These goals will not help me achieve marks for this project and also help develop my skills to push even further. 
        </div>

        <h2> Scope </h2>
        <div id="task-1-text">
            The website ought to function like any other website, so it needs: navigation, responsiveness to screen size, links and images. These are basic functions of a website and therefore are needed for my website to have a basic level of functionality. For the content that would be displayed there would be: CARP task, typo task, coding task, UX task and a report. However, additional content could be added such as: other previous projects, information about myself and other images/videos/sounds.

        <h2> Flow Chart </h2>
        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item">
                <img id="flow-pic" src="images/8BF21D36-B651-4CBA-87FE-8202313F64AC.png" alt="picture of flowchart" style="width: 35%;">
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <p class="grid-text"> The flow chart was used to help gain an understanding of how our website will work - what order we would present our tasks in. I had initially opted
                for a single scrolling website where all the content will be displayed on one page. Howwever, as I progressed through the task I realised that when it
                came to displaying my work, that having multiple pages would be easier. Therefore, I used the flowchart to how the main home page would work. </p>

        <h2> Wireframes </h2>
        <div class="Pic-task4-container">
        <img id="task4-pic" src="images/home-wireframe.jpeg" alt="wireframe of home page" style="width: 15%;">
        <img id="task4-pic" src="images/CARP-wireframe.jpeg" alt="wireframe of CARP page" style="width: 15%;">
        <img id="task4-pic" src="images/typo-wireframe.jpeg" alt="wireframe of typo page" style="width: 15%;">
        <img id="task4-pic" src="images/HTML-wireframe.jpeg" alt="wireframe of HTML page" style="width: 15%;">
        <img id="task4-pic" src="images/UX-wireframe.jpeg" alt="wireframe of UX page" style="width: 15%;">
        <img id="task4-pic" src="images/report-wireframe.jpeg" alt="wireframe of report page" style="width: 15%;">
        </div>

        <div id="task-1-text">
            <p> Wireframes are really useful at understanding how you will layout your website, knowing if you have enough room to display certain content in a particular way. It also helps with
                writing the HTML and CSS and you know what will go where, and so won't have to visualise it in your head. I didn't stick to my wireframes completely, for example on the CARP page, 
                I instead changed the layout of the text and images in the middle of the page. Opting to switch them around for each new line.  </p>
