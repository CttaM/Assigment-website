                <h2> Axial </h2>
                <p class="grid-text"> The axial typographic system have a central axis where the text branches off it. 
                    this can either be symmetrical or asymmetrical. It is quite simple make, for me, I made each paragraph
                    have it's own text box to make it easier to move either side of the axis. I would make the text to the right of the axis justify
                    to the right. </p>

                <h2> Radial </h2>
                <p class="grid-text"> The radial typographic system has text "radiating" from a certian point. This can make
                    some text becoming more difficult to read due to the text being displayed at an angle. The way I created
                    the radial design to the right was by putting each line text in it's own text box. Then I would rotate
                    each one to the desired angle and then move it closer to the circle.  </p>

                <h2> Dilatational </h2>
                <p class="grid-text"> Dilatational is similar to Radial in the snese that they focus around a point. However, 
                    dilatational circle around a point rather than radiating out. To create this, I began by copying a the text 
                    I wanetd. Then I created a circle to the desried size that I wanted the text to circle. Select the text on 
                    path tool click on the outline of the circle. Paste your text.  </p>

                <h2> Random </h2>
                <p class="grid-text"> The random typographic system is what it says it is. There isn'y really any order to how
                    the text is displayed. In my design I used a variety of the typographic systems, such as dilatational and
                    transitional. I also used the twist tool in Illustrator to distort some of the text such as the two lines 
                    of white text in the pink section.  </p>

                <h2> Grid </h2>
                <p class="grid-text"> The grid layout is the most legible systems of the 8 disscussed here. This is because it 
                    puts text into neat columns and rows - no compilacted shapes and angles. In my design I put the text into
                    two columns and separated them with overlaping lines.  </p>

                <h2> Modular </h2>
                <p class="grid-text"> Modular is similar to grid, but in modular you don't have to stick to a grid of columns 
                    rows. Instead, you can break up the text into repeating structures. What I did in my design is to use circles
                    where they would mark places that the text would start or finish.  </p>

                <h2> Transitional </h2>
                <p class="grid-text"> Transitional designs look like the layers of the Earth in sediment and stone. One way to make
                    transitional designs work is by having them follow an element of design on the page. Like radial and dilatational,
                    it can be hard to read if thought has gone into how the text will be displayed, and what is more important to read
                    than others. </p>

                <h2> Bilateral </h2>
                <p class="grid-text"> Bilateral designs have text centred with each other. While this may seem uninspiring, 
                    to make the design more appealing, you can move text over the page and increase the gaps between sections of text.
                    In my design, the text on the left are centred with each other, and the same for the text on the right.  </p>
