        <p1> The CARP task was the first task that we were assigned. We had to create three draft posters for
            the True/False festival. The True/Fase festival being an annual film documentary festival. Then we had decide which one of our drafts we wanted to further improve.

            <p1> Task 2 was about learning the 8 typographic systems. A typographic system is way of laying out how text will be displayed in the piece of
                design being created. This is done to make your designs unique and stand out from any other, bceause as <a href="https://type365.com/2017/02/21/7-typographic-layout-systems/"><strong>Lucas Czarnecki</strong></a>

        <p1> Task 3 was where we learnt how to code HTML and CSS. We were given weekly worksheets on GitHub and they went step by step: from writing our first line of code
            to fully completing our websites. Despite having already done a foundation year and so knowing HTML and CSS before hand, I still learnt some new things. Such as,
            the "section" tag, how flex box works and more confident in how divs work. </p1>
