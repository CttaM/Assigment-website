                The task gave us the basics of HTML and CCS, including: what various HTML tags do, how to add images,
                create a nav bar and style our website.</p>

                    <p class="grid-text"> The pizza website was the first task that was had to do. Week 1 worksheet
                    introduced us the the basics of GitHub, and how to create a repository to host a website. This was
                    where we wrote our a first line of HTML code as well. Week 2 was about putting content on the 
                    website - mainly text. It introduced us to the variety of HTML elements such as: <strong>h1, h2, p, ul, ol,
                    a, and img.</strong> Week 3 was about making our webste look pretty using CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). We 
                    changed the background colour, changed fonts and typefaces, along with moving different elements over the
                    screen. The result of all this can be seen the right. </p>
