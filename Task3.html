                <br>
                The task gave us the basics of HTML and CCS, including: what various HTML tags do, how to add images,
                create a nav bar and style our website.</p>

                    <p class="grid-text"> The pizza website was the first task that was had to do. Week 1 worksheet
                    introduced us the the basics of GitHub, and how to create a repository to host a website. This was
                    where we wrote our a first line of HTML code as well. Week 2 was about putting content on the 
                    website - mainly text. It introduced us to the variety of HTML elements such as: <strong>h1, h2, p, ul, ol,
                    a, and img.</strong> Week 3 was about making our webste look pretty using CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). We 
                    changed the background colour, changed fonts and typefaces, along with moving different elements over the
                    screen. The result of all this can be seen the right. </p>

                    <h2> Flexbox Rundown </h2>
                    <p class="grid-text"> We skipped a week 4 worksheet to catch up on previous work. Therefore, the next worksheet we had
                        was in week 5. This work sheet introduced us to the Flexbox. The Flexbox is a way to display content in a website to
                    make it more responsive. The worksheet started off by creating a navigation bar in the header. Following on from that, 
                we made multiple sections, and each own had it's own problem. For example, in the first section we a had to cnetre an image of kitten, 
                    within the specified section. Then we had to insert two youtube videos, and make them centre with each other with one 
                    bellow the other. Finally we had to insert in audio file and style the caption with the "figcaption" tag.  </p>
