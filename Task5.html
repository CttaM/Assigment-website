            <p> Firstly, I am really proud of the way my website turned out, it is how I planned it to be. I wanted it to have a clean, and minimalist feel, that is why I only used three colours, all of which are a variation of red. I choose to use red as my main colour because, not only do I like the colour, but I feel that it also worked with the colours used in tasks one and two - which were also predominantly red. The layout of the website is quite simple, but in my opinion, it works well. The pictures are clearly laid out, and accompanying text can be clearly read and is obvious what it relates to. Furthermore, using a simple layout where most content is displayed line after line, rather next to each other, it made it easier to place content where I wanted it to be - mainly in the centre. However, I did struggle with centering items such as images and the navigation bar. I think was to do with my lack of understanding how flex box works, which something that I will develop further moving on.

                My favorite task was the Typography Task. This is because I have found styling text a challenge in previous designs I have done. But, doing this task has given me different tools and perspectives on how to arrange my text in future. I also liked doing the GitHub worksheets and generally working on my assignment website (this website). From the time I have been coding HTML for the worksheets and website, I feel more confident in my abilities compared to where I started. I had completed a foundation year previous to starting this course and on it we had a Web Foundations module. In this module, we also created a website and so when I started the Graphic and Web Design assignment I felt fairly confident. This is because I had a very basic understanding of HTML and CSS but there were some aspects I was still confused about from the Web Foundations module. One in particular was how divs worked, I used them last year without knowing what they did specifically, just that they worked every now and then when I was experimenting with code. But now, I feel more confident using them as they help to keep certain elements together in a group and particularly when applying CSS.

                If I had to do this assignment again, I would try to push my skills even further. I would like to have included some JavaScript, to make the website more dynamic and interactive. In addition, I would probably change the entire theme and layout of the website as well. I may try different colours that I havenâ€™t used before, and lay items out in more concise way (i.e. having text next to pictures more often).
