        <p> The CARP task was assigned to us to develop our skills in presentation, specifically in posters.
            CARP is an ancronym meaning: Contrast, Proximity, Repetition and Alignment.
            <br>
            <br>
            The CARP task was the first task that we were assigned. We had to create three draft posters for
            the True/False festival. Then we had decide which one of our drafts we wanted to further improve.
            I used a lot of contrast in posters, as well as using some of the typogrpahic techniques disscussed
            during week 3. More infomaton about each poster can be found bellow.</p>

                <h2> Poster 1 </h2>
                <p class="grid-text"> For poster 1, I wanted to used the logo as the main focal point for it's design.
                    For this reason I put it in the centre of the poster and used the diagonal contrast inside the 
                    logo as way to put contrast in the whole poster. I also made the colours of the title contrast with
                    eachother. In addition, each body of text is given it's own space (proximity). In terms of alignment,
                    it coincides with contrast, where the text alignment is opposite (contrast) with each other.</p>

                <h2> Poster 2 </h2>
                <p class="grid-text"> I took a different approach to poster two than I did to poster 1. I was inspired
                by the work that was done during week 3 when we learnt about the seven typographic systems. More
                specifically, I used the Modular typographic system where text is displayed using structures that are 
                repeated. Furthermore, I also included the typographic system of Dilatational for the title text. In 
                addition to the white and red contrasting with each other, I gave the white boxes a shadow, giving them 
                the appearance that they are coming off the page. </p>

                <h2> Poster 3 </h2>
                <p class="grid-text"> The thinking behind the design of poster 3 was a combination of the previous two. 
                I wanted to use both the logo and text as the main driving forces behind how the poster was layed out. 
                For example, I wanted the True / False logo to be a focal point, just like Poster 1. But in this instance, it
                was placed towards the bottom, but has text wraping around it. I wanted the poster to be somewhat simple but still
                use the elemants of CARP. This is why the banner that runs behind the text "True / False" was added, along with 
                a dropshadow. The Repetition part of CARP comes in the form of how the posters all use the same colours and typeface.
